# **Subject:** RE: Git & Package Managers

Howdy team,

Recently, our intern Tim has informed us that we should really be using the industry standard for version control "git", but a lot of us are having dependency issues when trying to run his deployment script (**deploy.sh**). Go ahead and clone his repository and figure out how to get his script to run. You may check the script itself to see what commands it uses

---
### **1. Clone Repository**
If you are reading this overview, then you likely already have cloned this repo

### **2. Upgrade Packages**
It seems as if cowsay is currently out of date. Please go ahead and upgrade all the packages in the system using **dnf**

### **3. Install the missing dependency**
One of the commands required to run the script is not currently installed, go ahead and install it using **dnf**

Thanks and Gig 'em,  
**Kevin G.**  
Systems Administration Lead
